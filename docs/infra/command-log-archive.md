# Command Log Archive Policy

Stellar Viaduct archives key CI and release command output so failed runs can be investigated after the live GitHub Actions log view expires or becomes hard to search.

## What is archived

The CI workflow writes one log file per key command group:

- dependency installation;
- backend lint, build, migration, and test commands;
- frontend lint, build, Storybook, unit test, and visual regression commands;
- Rust format, clippy, build, and test commands.

Each job also writes `COMMANDS.tsv`, `MANIFEST.tsv`, and `FILES.txt` into the archive before compression.

## Retention window

Command log archives uploaded from GitHub Actions use a 30-day retention window. This matches the troubleshooting window for short-lived CI failures and keeps storage use bounded.

For release investigations that must survive longer than 30 days, attach the compressed command-log archive to the GitHub Release alongside build artifacts.

## Searchability

Archives are compressed as `.tar.gz` files. After downloading an archive, extract it and search with standard command-line tools:

```bash
tar -xzf command-logs-*.tar.gz -C ./command-logs
grep -R "error\|failed\|panic\|warning" ./command-logs
cat ./command-logs/COMMANDS.tsv
```

`COMMANDS.tsv` maps logical step names to log file names. `MANIFEST.tsv` records workflow, job, run id, attempt, ref, and commit SHA.

## Artifact links

For CI runs:

1. Open the workflow run.
2. Scroll to **Artifacts**.
3. Download the artifact named `command-logs-<workflow>-<job>-<run>-<attempt>.tar.gz`.
4. Extract and search locally.

For releases:

1. Open the GitHub Release.
2. Check release assets for a command-log archive.
3. Download the `.tar.gz` archive and inspect it with the same commands above.

## Access control

Command logs are stored as GitHub Actions artifacts and, where applicable, GitHub Release assets. Access is controlled by GitHub repository permissions:

- public artifacts/assets are visible according to the repository visibility and GitHub Actions settings;
- private or restricted repositories require users to have repository access;
- secrets must not be printed in command output;
- workflow steps should rely on GitHub secret masking and must not echo raw token values.

## Compression

Archives are created with `tar -czf` and use gzip compression. This keeps related logs, indexes, and manifests together while remaining easy to download and inspect with default UNIX tooling.

## Release workflow note

Release jobs should call `bash scripts/archive-command-logs.sh` after build commands and upload the generated `${COMMAND_LOG_ARCHIVE}` as both:

- a GitHub Actions artifact with 30-day retention;
- a GitHub Release asset when the job has release upload permissions.

The archive file path and archive name are exported by `scripts/archive-command-logs.sh` through `GITHUB_ENV` as `COMMAND_LOG_ARCHIVE` and `COMMAND_LOG_ARCHIVE_NAME`.

## PR checklist

- [ ] CI command logs upload successfully for backend, frontend, and Rust jobs.
- [ ] Release jobs attach compressed command-log archives to release assets.
- [ ] The PR includes a closing reference to the assigned issue.
- [ ] No secrets or credentials are printed into command logs.
